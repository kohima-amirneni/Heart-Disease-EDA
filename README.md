# Heart Disease EDA

This project explores **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart disease dataset to identify key patterns, correlations, and insights related to cardiovascular health.  

## Project Overview
- Understand the dataset structure.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Explore feature distributions (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.).
- Visualize relationships between features and heart disease.
- Derive insights that could help in predicting heart disease.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains patient health information such as:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Chest Pain Type
  - Blood Pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting Blood Sugar
  - ECG results
  - Maximum Heart Rate
  - Exercise Induced Angina
  - ST Depression / Slope
  - Number of Major Vessels
  - Thalassemia
  - heart_disease (Heart Disease present: 1 / absent: 0)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
